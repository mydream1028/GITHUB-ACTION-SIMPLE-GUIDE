# Great GitHub Action Sample Guide

## 1. Why use this guide

### 1) Not just for studying, but also to be like seniors
There are several guides and tutorials to help you study github actions. But they only help you to learn syntax and some other basic knowledges, not the real problem-solving, or infrastructure.
This guide is for the developers who wanna be seniors.
This helps you not only how to use github actions, but how to write workflow actions, yaml and so on.

### 2) To learn how CI/CD pipeline works
There are thousand ways to create CI/CD pipelines. But working 9+ years several tech stacks, I've came with the idea of making this guide for everybody who wants to be like senior.
This will tell you how the CI and CD works, step by step, and let you do it by yourself.

### 3) Things you can learn from here
This sample guide uses MERN stack application that is pre-built. Not so bit app, just a simple.
When you make any changes in this app, make PR or commits to the main or next branch, it will be automatically deployed on AWS.
